# 8.Redis.conf详解

./redis-server xx/xx.conf 可以指定服务的配置文件

1. 配置文件unit单位大小写不敏感

   ```bash
   # units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.
   ```

2.  INCLUDES -- 可以包含其他配置文件

   ```bash
   # Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
   # have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
   # to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
   # other files, so use this wisely.
   ```

3. NETWORK -- 网络配置 

   - bind -- 绑定

     ```bash
     ################################## NETWORK #####################################

     # By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
     # for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.

     # Examples:
     #
     # bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1     # listens on two specific IPv4 addresses
     # bind 127.0.0.1 ::1              # listens on loopback IPv4 and IPv6
     # bind * -::*                     # like the default, all available interfaces
     ```

   - protected mode -- 保护模式

     ```bash
     # By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
     # you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
     # even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
     # are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
     # protected-mode yes
     protected-mode no
     ```

   - port -- 端口
   
     ```bash
     # Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379 (IANA #815344).
     # If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
     port 6379
     ```
   
4. GENERAL -- 通用设置

   - deamonize -- 守护进程

     ```bash
     # By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
     # Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
     # When Redis is supervised by upstart or systemd, this parameter has no impact.
     daemonize yes   # 如果不开启守护进行,则退出服务时,后台进程自动结束
     ```

   - pid file -- pid文件

     ```bash
     # If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup
     # and removes it at exit.
     #
     # When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
     # specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
     # is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/var/run/redis.pid".
     #
     # Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it
     # nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
     #
     # Note that on modern Linux systems "/run/redis.pid" is more conforming
     # and should be used instead.
     pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid  # 如果开启守护进程,则会生成一个对应端口的pid文件
     ```

   - log-- 日志

     - log level -- 日志级别

       ```bash
       # Specify the server verbosity level.
       # This can be one of:
       # debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
       # verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
       # notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
       # warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
       loglevel notice
       
       ```

     - log file -- 日志文件

       ```bash
       # Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
       # Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
       # output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
       logfile ""
       ```

   - database number -- 数据库数量

     ```bash
     # Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select
     # a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where
     # dbid is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1
     databases 16 # 默认16个
     ```

   - logo -- 标志

     ```bash
     # By default Redis shows an ASCII art logo only when started to log to the
     # standard output and if the standard output is a TTY and syslog logging is
     # disabled. Basically this means that normally a logo is displayed only in
     # interactive sessions.
     #
     # However it is possible to force the pre-4.0 behavior and always show a
     # ASCII art logo in startup logs by setting the following option to yes.
     always-show-logo no
     ```

5. SNAPSHOTTING -- 快照（持久化） -- rdb配置

   持久化 -- 经过多少操作/时间后，生成快照，持久化到文件（.rdb, .aof）

   redis是内存型数据库，需要进行持久化来防止数据丢失

   ```bash
   # Save the DB to disk.
   #
   # save <seconds> <changes>
   
   # save 3600 1  # 3600秒内有1个key进行了修改，则进行持久化操作
   # save 300 100  # 300秒内有100个key进行了修改，则进行持久化操作
   # save 60 10000  # 60秒内有10000个key进行了修改，则进行持久化操作
   
   # By default Redis will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
   # (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
   stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes # 持久化失败，redis是否继续工作
   
   # Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
   # By default compression is enabled as it's almost always a win.
   rdbcompression yes # 是否压缩rdb文件（压缩需要消耗cpu资源）
   
   # RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
   # tell the loading code to skip the check.
   rdbchecksum yes  # rdb文件保存时错误校验
   
   
   # The working directory.
   # Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
   dir ./  # 持久化文件生成目录
   
   ```

6. REPLICATION -- 主从复制

7. SECURITY -- 安全

   - 密码

     ```bash
     # requirepass foobared # 设置密码，一把使用命令设置
     ```

     ```bash
     127.0.0.1:6379> config get requirepass  # 获取redis密码
     1) "requirepass"
     2) ""
     127.0.0.1:6379> config set requirepass 123456  # 设置redis密码
     OK
     # 重启/新客户端生效
     127.0.0.1:6379> ping
     (error) NOAUTH Authentication required.
     127.0.0.1:6379> auth 123456  # 确认redis密码
     OK
     127.0.0.1:6379> ping
     PONG
     ```

8. CLIENTS -- 客户端

   ```bash
   # Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
   # this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
   # able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
   # the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
   # minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
   
   # maxclients 10000  # 客户端最大连接数
   ```

9. MEMORY MANAGEMENT -- 内存管理

   ```bash
   # Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
   # When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
   # according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
   
   # maxmemory <bytes>  # 最大内存数
   
   # MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
   # is reached. You can select one from the following behaviors:
   #
   # 只对设置了过期时间的key进行lru
   # volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.
   # 对所有的key进行lru
   # allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
   # 最对这是了过期时间的key进行lfu
   # volatile-lfu -> Evct using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.
   # 对所有key进行lfu
   # allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
   # 随机删除即将过期的key
   # volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.
   # 随机删除key
   # allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
   # 删除即将过期的key
   # volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
   # 默认值，不做任何操作，返回错误信息
   # noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
   #
   # LRU means Least Recently Used
   # LFU means Least Frequently Used
   #
   # Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
   # randomized algorithms.
   #
   # The default is:
   #
   # maxmemory-policy noeviction  # 内存策略
   
   ```

10. APPEND ONLY MODE -- AOF（Append Only File）配置

    ```bash
    # By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
    # good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
    # a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
    # the configured save points).  默认rdb已经够用，但是如果出现进程问题或停电，可能或丢失几分钟的写入
    #
    # The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
    # much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
    # (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
    # dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
    # wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
    # still running correctly. # aof模式一般只会丢失一秒钟的数据或者一次写入
    #
    # AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
    # If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
    # with the better durability guarantees.
    
    appendonly no # 默认不开启aof模式，使用red模式进行持久化，大部分情况下rdb已经够用
    
    # The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")
    
    appendfilename "appendonly.aof"  # aof文件名
    
    # The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
    # instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
    # data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
    #
    # Redis supports three different modes:
    #
    # no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
    # always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
    # everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
    #
    # The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
    # speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
    # "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
    # it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
    # some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
    # or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
    # everysec.
    #
    # If unsure, use "everysec".
    
    # appendfsync always  
    appendfsync everysec
    # appendfsync no
    ```
